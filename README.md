# Stonix
Stonix is a hobby project of mine. I want to create my own small AI named Stonix.
For those who are interested, the name is simply a technical version of my username.

# Stonix PSL
Stonix PSL (Pretrained Small Language Model) is the language model branch of Stonix.
I'm also working on an image recognition model for Stonix: [Stonix Vision](https://github.com/Stoniye/Stonix-Vision)
